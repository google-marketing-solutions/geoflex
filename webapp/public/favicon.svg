      Zigzag line:
      - Starts near bottom-left: M-9,9
      - First segment goes up-right, above the yellow dot (0,-2), to P1(0,-4). Length approx 15.8. Slope -13/9.
      - Second segment goes down-right from P1(0,-4) to P2(3,-0.3).
      - Third segment goes up-right from P2(3,-0.3) to End(9,-9) near top-right. Length approx 10.54. Slope -8.67/6 (approx -13/9).
      This path ensures the line detours above the yellow dot at (0,-2).
      The first segment is longer than the third, and their angles are approximately symmetrical.

      Arrow at the tip of the zigzag (9,-9), pointing diagonally up-right.
      The prongs are calculated based on the direction of the last line segment (from (3,-0.3) to (9,-9)).
      Tip at (9,-9). Prong ends are approximately (8.7,-6.8) and (7.0,-7.9).
