# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## What do I do if I get a better MDE from a different library?

Other libraries estimate their minimum detectable effects using different assumptions, and if any of those assumptions don't hold for your data then the MDEs will not be reliable.

If you have another geo testing methodology that you believe performs better than the ones built into GeoFleX, then we suggest defining a new custom GeoFleX methodology and evaluating your methodology using GeoFleX. This makes sure you are comparing the MDE of your method in a fair, like-for-like way with all others.

Then you can still use GeoFleX, but with your custom methodology powering your test.
